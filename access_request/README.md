# Access Request Documents

The dociments here relate to my Access to Information request to the University of Prince Edward Island.

In the **to_upei** directory you'll find documents I sent to UPEI to apply for access; in the **from_upei** directory you'll find correspondence that I received in reply, and in *forms* directory you'll find the Student Parking Permit application form and the Access to Information request form from UPEI as of January 2018.
