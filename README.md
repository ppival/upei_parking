# University of PEI Parking Permits Data

The data and information you'll find here relate to my Access to Information request to the University of Prince Edward Island for data related to the year, make, and model of cars for which student parking permits were purchased.

You can read more about the genesis of this idea and how the access request proceeded, [in this blog post](https://ruk.ca/content/i-paid-166-data-about-parked-cars).
